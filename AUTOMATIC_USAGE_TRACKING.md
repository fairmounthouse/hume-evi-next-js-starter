# 🚀 Automatic Usage Tracking & Limit Enforcement

Big Daddy, your interview platform now has **BULLETPROOF** automatic usage tracking and limit enforcement! 🔒

## 🎯 **What's Now Automatic**

### **✅ Pre-Interview Limit Checks**
- **Before** users can start an interview, the system checks their limits
- **Blocks** users who have exceeded their plan limits
- **Shows** beautiful upgrade prompts with usage details
- **Prevents** wasted resources on blocked users

### **✅ Automatic Usage Tracking**
- **Tracks minutes** used during each interview session
- **Tracks daily interview count** automatically
- **Tracks detailed analysis** usage when generated
- **Tracks video review** usage (when implemented)

### **✅ Real-Time Limit Enforcement**
- **Locks out** users who exceed limits
- **Shows remaining** usage in real-time
- **Displays upgrade prompts** when limits are reached
- **Handles unlimited** plans properly (-1 = unlimited)

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **1. Pre-Interview Check Component**
**File:** `components/InterviewLimitCheck.tsx`
- Checks both minutes and daily interview limits
- Shows progress bars and remaining usage
- Blocks interview start if limits exceeded
- Beautiful upgrade prompts with Crown icons

### **2. Updated Interview Setup**
**File:** `components/InterviewSetup.tsx`
- Integrated `InterviewLimitCheck` component
- Start button disabled if limits exceeded
- Real-time limit checking with user feedback

### **3. Automatic Session Tracking**
**File:** `components/StartCall.tsx`
- Uses new `createSessionWithBilling()` function
- Automatically creates users in billing system
- Links sessions to billing records

### **4. Interview Completion Tracking**
**File:** `components/Chat.tsx` (handleEndInterviewWithData)
- Tracks minutes used when interview ends
- Tracks daily interview count
- Calculates duration from actual session time
- Non-blocking (won't break interviews if tracking fails)

### **5. Feature Usage Tracking**
**File:** `app/api/transcript/final_evaluation/route.ts`
- Tracks detailed analysis usage
- Only allows if user has feature access
- Automatic billing integration

## 📊 **Usage Types Tracked**

| Usage Type | Description | Reset Period |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| `minutes_per_month` | Interview minutes used | Monthly |
| `interviews_per_day` | Daily interview count | Daily |
| `detailed_analysis_per_month` | Analysis reports generated | Monthly |
| `video_review_per_month` | Video reviews used | Monthly |

## 🎮 **How It Works**

### **1. User Starts Interview Setup**
```
1. User visits /interview/setup
2. InterviewLimitCheck component loads
3. Checks minutes_per_month and interviews_per_day limits
4. Shows usage status and remaining limits
5. Enables/disables start button based on limits
```

### **2. User Starts Interview**
```
1. StartCall component creates session with createSessionWithBilling()
2. Automatically creates user in billing system if needed
3. Links session to user for tracking
4. Interview proceeds normally
```

### **3. User Completes Interview**
```
1. Chat component handles interview end
2. Calculates actual duration in minutes
3. Calls /api/billing/track-usage with interview_session type
4. Tracks both minutes and daily interview count
5. Updates usage in database
```

### **4. User Requests Analysis**
```
1. User clicks for detailed analysis
2. API checks if user has detailed_analysis feature
3. If allowed, generates analysis and tracks usage
4. If not allowed, returns 403 with upgrade prompt
```

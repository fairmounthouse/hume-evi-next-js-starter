## Problem Section

### Section Header
**The Problem**

### Main Title
**Traditional Prep Creates Polished Robots**

### Subtitle
You're not failing interviews because you lack experience. You're failing because you sound scripted.

### Problem Points

1. **You memorize 50 STAR stories**
   - Spending weeks crafting perfect responses that sound rehearsed and inauthentic

2. **You freeze on follow-ups**
   - When interviewers go off-script, your rehearsed answers fall apart

3. **Generic feedback wastes time**
   - "Be more specific" doesn't help when you don't know what specific means

### Reality Check Box
**Reality Check**

**Real interviews are dynamic conversations,** not Q&A sessions. When you sound scripted, interviewers tune out. You need practice that mirrors reality—where every answer shapes the next question.

## Solution Section

### Section Header
**The Solution**

### Main Title
**AI That Interviews Like Humans Do**

### Subtitle
Stop memorizing. Start conversing. Get hired.

### Feature 1: Dynamic Conversations
**Title**: Dynamic Conversations
**Short Description**: No two interviews are the same. Our AI adapts its questions based on your answers.
**Full Description**: Experience real interview dynamics where your responses shape the conversation. Our AI picks up on subtle cues, asks relevant follow-ups, and challenges you just like a seasoned interviewer would.
**Stat**: ∞ Unique Paths

**Example Conversation**:
- **AI**: "Tell me about a time you led a difficult project."
- **You**: "I led a team of 5 engineers to rebuild our payment system..."
- **AI Follow-up**: "Interesting. How did you handle the engineer who initially resisted the new architecture?"
- **Insight**: AI picked up on unstated tension and probed deeper

### Feature 2: Feedback That Actually Helps
**Title**: Feedback That Actually Helps
**Short Description**: Get specific, actionable feedback on exactly what to improve—not generic advice.
**Full Description**: Receive detailed analysis of your responses with concrete examples of how to improve. Our AI identifies patterns in your answers and provides targeted coaching.
**Stat**: 94% Improvement Rate

**Example**:
- **Generic Feedback**: "Your answer needs more detail"

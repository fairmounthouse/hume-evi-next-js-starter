# New File Request: middleware.ts

- Purpose: Add Clerk middleware using App Router approach with `clerkMiddleware()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`.
- Location: Project root (`middleware.ts`).

## Duplicate Functionality Search

- Searched entire repository for existing Clerk setup: no occurrences of `clerk`, `ClerkProvider`, or existing `middleware.ts` were found.
- Verified `app/layout.tsx` did not contain any Clerk wrappers prior to this change.
- Confirmed there was no prior `pages/`-based auth or deprecated `authMiddleware()` usage.

## Implemented File

```ts
// middleware.ts
import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export default clerkMiddleware();

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    "/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)",
    "/(api|trpc)(.*)",
  ],
};

## New Files: Clerk Auth Routes

- Purpose: Provide dedicated routes for user authentication using Clerk components.
- Locations:
  - `app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`
  - `app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`

### Duplicate Functionality Search
- Searched for existing auth pages/components: looked for `SignIn`, `SignUp`, `sign-in`, `sign-up`, and Clerk components across the repo. None found.
- Verified there are no `pages/`-based auth routes or legacy Clerk usage.

### Implemented Files
- `app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`: renders `<SignIn />` centered.
- `app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`: renders `<SignUp />` centered.

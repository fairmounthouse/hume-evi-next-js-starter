- Primary CTA: See Your Blind Spots Now; Go to Dashboard; Start Your Reality Check; 5-Minute Live Mock

#### components/landing/Problem.tsx
- Section title: You Know Every Framework. So Why Do They Keep Saying "Not Quite Ready"?
- Lead: Because this isn't about knowledge. It's about how you react when a partner says: "Your math is wrong. Explain your logic."
- Subsection title: The Invisible Failures:
- Items: Your shoulders tense — Partners read: defensive; Your voice rises — Partners think: uncertain; You break eye contact — Partners see: not confident; You speed up — Partners know: panicking
- The Hard Truth: Stats — 73% fail due to presence; 0% can see own body language tells; $200K+ average cost of mistakes

#### components/landing/Solution.tsx
- Section title: What We Catch That No One Else Can
- Lead: Other platforms listen to your words. We analyze everything else that actually determines your offer.
- Features:
  - Live Visual Intelligence — We're the only platform with real-time video analysis... Every tell that costs you offers.

- Stories: The Ceiling-Starer (Wharton '24); The Speed-Talker (HBS '24); The Defender (INSEAD '24)
- Why This Changes Everything: Other Platforms — Practice cases — Can't see your tells; Mock Partners — Practice interviews — Too polite to mention; Us — Practice performing under scrutiny — Nothing hidden
- CTA block: Start Your Reality Check — 5-Minute Live Mock Interview — With full video analysis, real-time coaching, and detailed breakdown — See Your Blind Spots Now — Warning: You won't like what you see. But you'll love what you become.
